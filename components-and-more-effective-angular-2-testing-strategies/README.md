# Components and More: Effective Angular 2 Testing Strategies

## Abstract

Angular 2 has reached release candidate! With it comes new opportunities for brilliantly authored and well-tested applications! While tests don't come free, they're well worth the time and effort -- especially for larger or long-lived codebases.

We'll explore the full gamut of Angular 2 testing: What to test, how to test, classifications of tests, and the implications and tradeoffs for each of these decisions. Soon you'll be ready to `npm test` Angular 2 projects with confidence -- no Angular 1.x experience required!
